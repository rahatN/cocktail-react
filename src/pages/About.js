     <p>For my book The Authority Gap, which looks at why women
        are still taken less seriously than men, I commissioned 
         Book Research to find out exactly who was reading what.
          I wanted to know whether female authors were not just
           deemed less authoritative than men, but whether they
            were being read by men in the first place. And the
             results confirmed my suspicion that
        men were disproportionately unlikely even to open a book
         by a woman.
